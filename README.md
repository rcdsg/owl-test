# WordPress/PHP Engineer

Dear Candidate,

First, we are happy you get this far on our hiring process, congratulations. We created this little challenge for you to show your coding skills. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Roughly you have up to two weeks to send it in.

## The Task

- Create a website;
- On the home page, we need a list with all registered breeds;
- As a user, I want to view the breed detail page when I click one of those;
- As a pet parent, I can add personal experience related to the same breed that my pet belongs to â€” filling a form;
- Write README.md instructions on how to get your code up-and-running;
- Send us your code useing a private **Gitlab** repository. Add to the gitlab repository project the user @oowlish-career as a "Maintainer";
- To create your theme, you must extend it from the `Twenty Nineteen`.

_We kindly ask you not to publish your implementation, to avoid online spoilers._

Feel free to use any plugin you deem necessary, but know that we'll also consider your choices around this topic.

## Our review

The focus of the review is on answering some questions such as:

- Is the website WordPress? (Obviously!?)
- The form data was sent via AJAX and also persisted on the WordPress database?
- Are your docs clear?
- Does your application launch?
- Does the application do what it promises?
- Can we find bugs or minor flaws?
- Did you provide a complete product ready to deploy?

Extra points for:

- Docker;
- One-command setup;
- Well written documentation.

The following things most probably will not impress us:

- Implementing additional features;
- Typos, grammar mistakes in documentation and code.

That said, good luck and happy coding!
